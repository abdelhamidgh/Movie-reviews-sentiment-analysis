# Movie Review Sentiment Analysis 

This project performs sentiment analysis on movie reviews to classify them as **positive** or **negative** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning techniques. The implementation is done in a Jupyter Notebook for clear, step-by-step exploration.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: tokenization, stopword removal, and optional stemming/lemmatization  
- **Text Representation**: word embeddings for deep learning models  
- **Model Training**: comparison of three architectures:
  - Simple Neural Network (SNN)
  - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
  - Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
- **Evaluation**: accuracy and loss metrics on test data  
- **Interactive Notebook**: well-commented and easy to modify
